# Cleaning Management

I will be attempting to create a system by which I can track the cleaning activities and who performed them at the escape room I work at because I have been put in charge of all cleaning.

## Planning
Need to get everyone's login pins.
Create entries for each day of the week and monthly cleaning activities.
Allow managers and myself to view checklists of what's been done.
Allow employees to enter their pin to claim they've done a job.
